## Computational Narratology

### Complex Event Processing

How might the processing and comprehension of stories' [fabulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabula_and_syuzhet) relate to other existing techniques for processing and analyzing various other kinds of chronologically-sorted sequences of events, e.g., [complex event processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing)?

In these regards, extensible [knowledge-graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) approaches to representing events and processing such streams of events are of interest.

### Composite Stateful Systems

Whether represented using [graph nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)), [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), or [embedding vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)), concepts of [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)) are both fundamental and important to computer science.

Considered, here, are communicating sets of stateful systems, e.g., [finite-state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) and [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory), and how these techniques can be brought to bear with respect to the challenges of computationally processing and comprehending stories.

Will artificial-intelligence systems processing incrementally-arriving stories represent their state progressions as simple sequences of graph nodes, knowledge graphs, or embedding vectors?

Might, instead, systems' states be composite, each including multiple graph nodes, knowledge graphs, or embedding vectors?

Regardless of whether systems' states are simple or composite, how might deltas or [differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_differencing) between consecutive states be obtained and analyzed?
