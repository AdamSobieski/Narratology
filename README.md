Ideas presented, here, in support of computational narratology, include:

* [Constraints](Content/Constraints.md) &ndash; a constraint-logic system with a fluent constraint-builder.
* [Knowledge](Content/Knowledge.md) &ndash; a knowledge system with propositions, rules, queries, and intensional sets.
  * [Concepts](Content/Concepts.md) &ndash; towards computing with concepts.
