# Computational Narratology

Ideas presented, here, in support of computational narratology include:

* [Automata](Content/Automata.md) &ndash; interfaces for general-purpose automata, acceptors, and transducers.
* [Constraints](Content/Constraints.md) &ndash; constraint-logic system with a fluent constraint-builder.
* [Knowledge](Content/Knowledge.md) &ndash; knowledgebase system with querying and inference.
