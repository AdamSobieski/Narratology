# Computational Narratology

Ideas presented, here, in support of computational narratology include:

* [Automata](Content/Automata.md) &ndash; interfaces for general-purpose automata, acceptors, and transducers.
* [Constraints](Content/Constraints.md) &ndash; a constraint-logic system with a fluent constraint-builder.
* [Knowledge](Content/Knowledge.md) &ndash; a knowledge system with expressions, rules, querying, and intensional sets.
  * [Concepts](Content/Concepts.md) &ndash; towards conceptual computing.
