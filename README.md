## Computational Narratology

### Introduction

Presented, [here](Content/Page1.md), is a computational narratology framework covering: [incremental interpretation and comprehension](Content/Page1.md#incremental-interpretation-and-comprehension), [differencing](Content/Page1.md#differencing), [semantics](Content/Page1.md#semantics), [curiosity](Content/Page1.md#curiosity), [prediction](Content/Page1.md#prediction), [confidence](Content/Page1.md#confidence), [attention](Content/Page1.md#attention), [working memory and buffers](Content/Page1.md#working-memory-and-buffers), [concurrency](Content/Page1.md#concurrency), [overlays](Content/Page1.md#overlays), [cognitive workflow and timelines](Content/Page1.md#cognitive-workflow-and-timelines), and [communication and question-answering](Content/Page1.md#communication-and-question-answering).

### Fabulae, Event Stream Processing, and Complex Event Processing

How does processing and comprehending stories' [fabulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabula_and_syuzhet), their chronologically-sorted sequences of events separable from their various possible narrations and tellings, relate to other techniques for processing sequences of chronologically-sorted streams and sequences of events?
