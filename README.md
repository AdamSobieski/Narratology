## Computational Narratology

### Complex Event Processing

How might the processing and comprehension of stories' [fabulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabula_and_syuzhet) relate to other existing techniques for processing and analyzing various other kinds of chronologically-sorted sequences of events, e.g., [complex event processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing)?

In these regards, extensible [knowledge-graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) approaches to representing events and processing such streams of events are of interest.

### Complex Stateful Systems

Representing systems' [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)) is of fundamental importance to computer science. Contemporary possibilities, in these regards, include uses of [graph nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)), [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), and [embedding vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)).

Considered, here, are sets of intercommunicating stateful systems, e.g., [finite-state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) and [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory), and how these techniques, involving concurrency, can be brought to bear to address the challenges of computationally processing and comprehending stories.

Will artificial-intelligence systems processing incrementally-arriving story events represent their state progressions as simple sequences of graph nodes, knowledge graphs, or embedding vectors? Might, instead, systems' states be composite, each state containing multiple graph nodes, knowledge graphs, or embedding vectors? Regardless of whether systems' states are simple or composite, as systems' states are progressed through as a result of processing incoming story events, how might deltas or [differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_differencing) between consecutive states be obtained and analyzed?
