## Computational Narratology

### Complex Event Processing

How might the processing and comprehension of stories' [fabulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabula_and_syuzhet) relate to other existing techniques for processing and analyzing various other kinds of chronologically-sorted sequences of events, e.g., [complex event processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing)?

In these regards, extensible [knowledge-graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) approaches to representing events and processing such streams of events are of interest.

### Composite Stateful Systems and Concurrency

Whether represented using [graph nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)), [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), or [embedding vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)), concepts of [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)) are both fundamental and important to computer science.

Considered, here, are coupled, communicating sets of stateful systems, e.g., [finite-state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) and [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory), and how these techniques can be brought to bear with respect to the challenges of computationally processing and comprehending stories.

Will artificial-intelligence systems processing incrementally-arriving stories represent their state progressions as simple sequences of graphs' nodes, knowledge graphs, or embedding vectors? Could deltas or [differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_differencing) be obtained between pairs of consecutive states?

Could complex systems' states be each considered as being composite, each including multiple graph nodes, knowledge graphs, or embedding vectors?
