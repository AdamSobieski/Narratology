## Computational Narratology

### Introduction

Presented, [here](Content/Page1.md), is a framework supporting: [incremental interpretation and comprehension](Content/Page1.md#incremental-interpretation-and-comprehension), [differencing](Content/Page1.md#differencing), [semantics](Content/Page1.md#semantics), [curiosity](Content/Page1.md#curiosity), [prediction](Content/Page1.md#prediction), [confidence](Content/Page1.md#confidence), [attention](Content/Page1.md#attention), [working memory and buffers](Content/Page1.md#working-memory-and-buffers), [concurrency](Content/Page1.md#concurrency), [overlays](Content/Page1.md#overlays), [cognitive workflow and timelines](Content/Page1.md#cognitive-workflow-and-timelines), and [communication and question-answering](Content/Page1.md#communication-and-question-answering).

### Complex Event Processing

How might the processing and comprehension of stories' [fabulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabula_and_syuzhet) relate to other existing techniques for processing and analyzing various other kinds of chronologically-sorted sequences of events, e.g., [complex event processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing)?

In these regards, semantic approaches to representing events and processing streams of such events are of interest.

### Communicating Automata and Concurrency

Whether represented using [graph nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)) or [embedding vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)), the concept of [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)) is fundamental and important to computer science.

Considered, here, are coupled, communicating sets of [finite-state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), e.g., [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory), and how these techniques can be brought to bear with respect to the challenges of computationally processing and comprehending stories.

Will artificial-intelligence systems processing incrementally-arriving stories represent their state progressions as simple sequences of graphs' nodes or embedding vectors? Could complex systems' individual states, additionally or instead, be considered as being composite, each including multiple graphs' nodes or embedding vectors?
